                  <h2>UPVc doors</h2>
                  <p>For you and for any visitor to your home, the entrance will be where first impressions are made. however, it is also where unwanted guests can make their entrance â€“ not only intruders (70% of all burglars enter through a door) but also draughts and noise. Security and energy saving are two important features.</p>
				  <p>Security is provided by the inclusion of multi-point locks, which feature "Hooks &amp; Claws" that slide into place one the doors is locked and a virtually impossible to defeat from the outside.<br>
Although "brilliant white" gives the classic look, choosing a special finish or colour could make all the difference and turn you door into a grand entrance. Many of these colours come in Wood effect,&nbsp;&nbsp;the effect is added as part of the manufacturing process, which means it's permanent and won't peel off or fade.</p>

                  <h2>Bi Fold Doors</h2>
                  <p>Once opened, the doors fold in a way that stacks them to the side of the opening, giving a considerably larger clear area than any other style of patio door. You can choose whether the doors stack to the right or left of the opening or even if they stack inside or outside.</p>
				  <p>As you may tell from the name, the special feature of this design is the sliding / folding action. The doors (or leaves) themselves are linked together by hinges and set into guide rails at the top and bottom.</p>
