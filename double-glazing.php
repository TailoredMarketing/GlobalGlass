       	  	<h1>Double Glazing</h1>
          	<p>We are continually raising the standards when it comes to the wide range of windows we have to offer.  You can chose from many different styles and materials to ensure the windows hold your own personal touch!</p>
            <p>The windows come in white, rosewood woodgrain and light oak, with plenty of different opening styles to choose from.</p>
            <p>Some of these styles include;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Casement windows &#8211; One of the most popular design of replacement window, normally seen with outward opening panes that can be top or side hinged.</li>
                <li>Sash windows- This design is characterised by open upwards &amp; downwards sliding action of the window frames.</li>
                <li>French windows- This frame is a double opening side hinged window, very popular when used as doors.</li>
                <li>Tilt/ turn windows- This window has a unique ability to open inwards, from the side, or tilt inwards from the bottom of the frame.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The majority of windows we supply and fit, will feature Multi-point locking systems that keep the windows closed securely. The sealed double glazed units and window beading are fitted from the inside, to make it very difficult for them to be removed by intruders.</p>
